Weather
=======


Description
-----------

Finally, a python library to control the weather. We've taken great care in 
making sure it's easy to use. Just import whatever type of Weather you want
and then you can activate it with one command. And of course it's all 
object oriented!


Usage
-----

It's really simple to use Weather. Here, let me show you how:

    >>> from weather import Cool
    >>> Cool().activate()
    It's now 19.0 degrees Celsius.


And if you want to keep the weather object around, you can do that too, of 
course!

    >>> from weather import Moderate
    >>> localweather = Moderate()
    >>> localweather.activate()
    It's now 25.0 degrees Celsius.

Motivation

It's annoyingly hot here right now and I may or may not be delusional from 
the heat.
